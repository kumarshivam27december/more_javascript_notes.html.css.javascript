/*first thing we should know is file name 
   second thing is extension
   we usually store it in text file
   i.e.   .txt file in notepad
   by default space is a seperator in the file
              comma is also a seperator
              # is also a seperator
              
              
              
              
it is not a case sensitive so no two file with same name it will 
over write*/
